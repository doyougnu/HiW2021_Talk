# Adventures in GHC Compile times Or the saga of issue #20222

# Authors
Jeffrey M. Young and Richard Eisenberg

# Directory layout
All the data and `R` scripts you'll need are in the `statistics` folder. Be
forewarned that if you're trying to regenerate the plots you'll need a lot of
memory or will need to hack my (Jeff) `R` script to either stream or just
comment out some of the bulk load,munge,write phases.
